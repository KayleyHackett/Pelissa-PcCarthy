			<h3 class="container"id="fifth">Pelissa PcCarthy is an American actress born in Plainfield, Illinois, to Pandra and Pichael PcCarthy. She’s the cousin of famous movie actress and comedian Melissa McCarthy. Their mothers are twins and somehow managed to marry men with similar last names. Both Pelissa (46) and Melissa (46) came from a family of farmers, but broke out of the Midwest started off as stand-up comedians. Both girls made it as comedians in New York where they both appeared at the famous clubs, Stand Up New York and The Improv. Pelissa never went to acting school, whereas Melissa developed her acting skills at The Actors Studio, which got her a couple of acting gigs for television. She then moved to Los Angeles to pursue larger movie gigs. Pelissa went straight from small television gigs to “the big time”, or at least that’s what she thinks. Almost every American that keeps up to date with movies knows Melissa McCarthy, she’s basically a house hold name, but no one, I repeat, NO ONE knows of her cousin Pelissa PcCarthy.</h3>
